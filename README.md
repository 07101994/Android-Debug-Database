# Android Debug Database

## Android Debug Database is a powerful library for debugging databases and shared preferences in Android applications.

### Android Debug Database allows you to view databases and shared preferences directly in your browser in a very simple way.

### What can Android Debug Database do?
* See all the databases.
* See all the data in the shared preferences used in your application.
* Run any sql query on the given database to update and delete your data.
* Directly edit the database values.
* Search in your data.
* Sort data.


### Using Android Debug Database Library in your application
Add this to your app's build.gradle
```groovy
debugCompile 'com.amitshekhar.android:debug-db:0.2.0'
```

Use `debugCompile` so that it will only compile in your debug build and not in your release apk.

Thatâ€™s all, just start the application, you will see in the logcat an entry like follows :

* D/DebugDB: Open http://XXX.XXX.X.XXX:8080 in your browser

* You can also always get the debug address url from your code by calling the method `DebugDB.getAddressLog();`

Now open the provided link in your browser.

Important : Your Android phone and laptop should be connected to the same Wifi Network.

You will see something like this :
